    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-11-24</p>

    <p>
      Personal Expenses Tracking is designed to work without collecting personal data.
      We do not run ads, do not sell data, and do not track you across apps or websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>None.</strong> The app does not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      Transactions, categories, vendors, products, and settings are stored locally on your device.
      You can delete this data at any time by removing the app from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the barcode scanning feature, the app will request access to the camera.
      Camera access is only used to scan product barcodes and is not used in the background.
      We do not record, store, or transmit camera images.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>Personal Expenses Tracking does not include third‑party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Premium features are offered through Apple’s in‑app purchase system.
      We do not receive your payment details. Apple may provide us with anonymous purchase validation.
    </p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app may use Apple frameworks (such as StoreKit) required to deliver purchases.
      No personal data is shared with us through these frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Personal Expenses Tracking is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If we change this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
    </p>
